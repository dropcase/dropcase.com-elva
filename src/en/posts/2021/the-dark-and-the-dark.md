# Every Year, the Same Damn Thing

The turning of the seasons, especially in places like where I live in the northeastern US. It's not even the cold that's the hardest part (for me, anyway). It's how little time you have to enjoy light during these months, even less so in about a month from when I'm writing this.

I know my friends in Sweden have it even less - they're over on the GÃ¶thenburg side and only see 3-4 hours of daylight in December. We get the shortest days at around 8-9 hours.

The first wave is noticing how early it is when it's dark. You'd think that it would be obvious, but it's the few minutes that get less light. They stack up until you notice that it's barely after dinner and you'd think it was bedtime.
