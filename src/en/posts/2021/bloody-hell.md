So far I've been learning about how Eleventy works, and I like it. Straightforward, pretty much javascript-driven Static Site Generator (SSG). My workflow to get new pages needs some attention, but there's plenty I have to talk about. The progress is the story around __getting__ to where I'm writing again, using Eleventy.

After trying hexo as the SSG for my site, I stalled while trying to figure out how I could use it better. There's a significant gap between the last thing I wrote and today. I wanted to learn something new, and still use an SSG.

Hugo? Maybe but no. Gatsby! Yeah, learn a bit about it, start reading some of the docs. Even make a repo to use with it! Stuck on something getting it set up before I could get anything written (yes, that's my issue). There are several "starting point" entries scattered around my systems. Maybe I'll roll it all into one place. Eventually.

## What's this? YASSG?

Eleventy. Sounds great, what do I need to do to try it out? Oh, install it, write one markdown file, and serve it? Ok sure! Wait, what if I want to use it to run my site? Blog starter? Nice, I'll clone that and start from there.

__Fin.__
