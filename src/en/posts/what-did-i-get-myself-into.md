## ...or, Why Didn't I Start This When I Wasn't Doing So Much Already?

(the original title reads better anyway)

It's been a weird and rough few weeks - at work, I've gone from a team of two to a team of one. On top of my current role as Supervisor, I'm also doing the day-to-day work of the person who was working under me[^1]. Oh, and backfilling the position, meaning that I'm reviewing resumes and interviewing people. Put all that together and my work day isn't as inviting as it used to be, which could be why I want to speed up the hiring process. Yes, I know that it's better to take my time and get the right person and not have to go through this again in three (or six or 12) months.

At home it's also busy. We've been taking the past several months to reduce the *stuff* all around the house. Anything that didn't make the cut was moved down into the garage... and once the garage was pretty full we had a big yard sale, and donated a bunch of other stuff. It felt good to get rid of a lot, just time-consuming to get to that point. Since all the stuff is out of the way maybe I can start getting the lingering projects finished and start on the other stuff that needs attention. blech.

I was really hoping I would have more time so I could write for here as well as on some personal projects. It feels like I need at least four more hours a day to get that done (factoring in time to actually get the stuff I need to get done finished). The summer feels like it's slipping away and there's still so much to try and cram in before winter hits.

Could I just win the lottery and have someone else do some (ok most) of the less fun junk for me?
