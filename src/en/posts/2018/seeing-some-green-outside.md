## Sunlight, Fresh Air, Growth, and Sunlight

(yes, I said that twice)

Every winter it happens. I think it's all good and I can deal with a few more weeks of cold and gray, then I realize that I want to get outside and see something green and fresh and alive. Maybe it's vitamin D deficiency, maybe it's cabin fever, or maybe I'm just dealing with something seasonal.

March was a rough month weather-wise. It seemed like we were going to be solidly into spring by now, but three snow days later and there's still more to melt. At least the past few days have been warmer.

Once Spring starts, we're one step closer to staying out on the screen porch until after dark, grilling without freezing, and opening the pool. I'm glad that the seasons change where I live (northeast US) so I can appreciate them in their own way. That's not to say that I wouldn't go somewhere else to enjoy nice weather more often...
