## ...or, architecting the site before I know better

I like [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) so far. It's easy to work with, I'm learning a lot along the way, and almost have it set up on all of my systems ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) makes it easy).

Next I need to find some best practice info on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), related to folder structure. It's great that I can do whatever I want; it's tough that I can do *whatever* I want.

### The What

A lot of what I'm doing will fall under the "blog" but I have other content that I want to post. Lists of Android Apps, Windows Apps, Linux apps, Podcasts, and more - across several categories for each area. There's also writing that I've done and the [Spark File](https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58) (ok, file**s**) I have.

Maybe the more generalized version of the breakdown is: braindump into the post entries, more organized stuff into pages. I'll probably change my mind about a dozen times before I get much further...

### To Do
- Theme
- Layout
- Plugins
- Write, write, write
