## Early Days

This month, July of 2017, will mark ten years of having a beard. That's the last time I shaved my face, the last time my cheeks and chin saw direct sunlight, and the last time I had razor burn. I had grown out facial hair a few times in my late teens and twenties, but never for more than a few months before shaving it all off.

My oldest kid is the only one to remember me beardless - my middle was only six months old when I stopped shaving. After a couple of years my wife told me, "I was looking at our wedding pictures and you look weird without the beard, you have to keep it..." (thanks?)

## Then and Now

It's weird, back when I first grew it out, there weren't a lot of people with full beards. Yes, there were plenty of people with facial hair - mustaches, goatees, fu manchu, soul patch, etc. etc. - but not a lot of full-on *beards*. My wife noticed it too, it's almost a movement with tons more people involved.

Now it's not uncommon to have a longer beard in the office (at least in my office it's the case). I like that.
