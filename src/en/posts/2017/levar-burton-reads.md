## Description
From the site: In each episode, host LeVar Burton (Reading Rainbow, Star Trek, Roots) hand-picks a different piece of short fiction, and reads it to you.

## My Take
As he says in the intros, "the only thing these stories have in common is that I love 'em." It's a great way to listen to short stories, both by authors you already know (like Neil Gaiman) and others you may not. He is a comforting voice and very welcome before or after a long day.

Whether you grew up with Reading Rainbow or not, you'll find something you like. There's only one "season" so far, but I'm hoping that there will be more. The episodes range from about 30 minutes to a little over an hour - and they're all worth every minute spent.
