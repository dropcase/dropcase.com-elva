## ...or, How Do I Pass the Time During My Long Commute?

I've been listening to podcasts since late 2006 when I got my first mp3 player (it was an early iPod Nano with 2 whole GB). Since then my playlist has changed quite a bit along with pretty much all of the process. Below is a quicker list of the current podcasts I'm listening to, or at least following for some that haven't updated in a while. At some point I'll post more about each one, especially the ones I've been listening to for a long time.

In alphabetical order by name, with a direct link to the feed:
