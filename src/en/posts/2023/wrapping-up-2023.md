This was a year of a lot of change, both for me personally as well as other areas of my life.

First, it was the longest break from work that I've had since 2010. My company has since discontinued this, but I was able to take a "recharge" block of time - four weeks off. That ended up being the month of April and it was mostly a great experience. I was able to travel and see friends that I haven't seen in person since pre-Covid (although we see each other on video a lot, it's just not the same).

I also helped house- and dog-sit, getting to have a space all to myself for a whole week. There were some other pieces to it, like having to head home to help out with kid logistics, but it wasn't a bad drive.

There was a lot of learning about myself too, reframing my childhood and digging into some heavier stuff in therapy. I've also decided that I don't care if people know I'm in therapy, it's been over 11 years since I started and it's helped me immensely.

Still glad to be where I am in the world (Maine, northeast US), less so with my current role for work. A lot of that has to do with progress in therapy and understanding who I am and what I want, but also with the changes the company has gone through in the past 18 months.

Part of me wishes I could make more changes to things around me, but that's part of what I'm dealing with anyway. The difference between the actual reality around me and what I'm starting to understand about myself aren't lining up and figuring out how to move forward is challenging.
