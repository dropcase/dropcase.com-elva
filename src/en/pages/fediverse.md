I joined my first instance in November 2022, having no idea what I was doing. It seemed like a much better option than other "social" media, with real people having actual discussions.

Since then I've found a group of people that I enjoy following and it's not all the "influencer" style interactions. It's people talking about what they care about, what they want to see in the world, and what they want to change.
